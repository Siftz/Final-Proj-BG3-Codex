<h2>Tavern Brawler Monk</h2>

<p><strong>Class:</strong> Monk (with Rogue multiclass)</p>
<p><strong>Race:</strong> Githyanki (recommended for Mage Hand and armor proficiencies)</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Outlander</p>

<h3>Stats</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> 17 (boosted to 20 via Tavern Brawler + ASI)</li>
    <li><strong>Dexterity:</strong> 14 (or 8 if using Gloves of Dexterity)</li>
    <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> 14</li>
    <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> 8</li>
    <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> 13</li>
    <li><strong>Charisma:</strong> 8</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build Summary</h3>
<p>
    This build focuses on <strong>Unarmed Attacks</strong> and <strong>Improvised Throws</strong>, scaling with high Strength. By multiclassing into Rogue (Thief), you gain an extra Bonus Action per turn, enabling multiple punches and throws. You can also start as a Fighter for early AC and survivability. Monk level 9 offers a damage spike, so staying Monk-heavy is optimal.
</p>

<h3>Character Creation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Race:</strong> Githyanki or Shield Dwarf (for early armor proficiency)</li>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> Monk</li>
    <li><strong>Subclass:</strong> Way of the Open Hand (recommended for damage and control)</li>
    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics, Acrobatics, Insight, Survival</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Strength and Constitution are key. Early Dexterity helps with AC, but can be dumped later if using gear like Gloves of Dexterity. Wisdom boosts Unarmored Defense if not using armor.

</ul>

<h3>Multiclassing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Monk 5 → Rogue 3:</strong> Subclass into Thief for extra Bonus Action</li>
    <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Rogue 4 for extra Feat, but Monk 9 offers better damage scaling</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative Start:</strong> Fighter → Monk → Rogue for early AC and shield use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay Strategy</h3>
<p>
    The Tavern Brawler Monk excels at combining <strong>Unarmed Strikes</strong> with <strong>Improvised Throws</strong>. Use your Actions to throw enemies, triggering extra punches via Bonus Actions. Open Hand subclass adds crowd control: knock prone, remove reactions, and disrupt enemy positioning.
</p>
<p>
    Creative combat is key — throw goblins, barrels, chairs, even potions. Just don’t hit allies with healing bottles unless you’re aiming to make things worse.
